# Computational Thinking
Computational Thinking (CT) is a problem-solving framework that breaks down complex problems into manageable parts using concepts from computer science. It consists of four key pillars:

1. Decomposition (Breaking down problems)
2. Pattern Recognition (Identifying similarities)
3. [Abstraction](./abstraction.md) (Focusing on essentials)
4. [Algorithm Design](./algorithms.md) (Creating step-by-step solutions)
