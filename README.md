# My Assembly Project

This project is designed to compile and run assembly code. Below are the details regarding the structure and usage of the project.

## Project Structure

```
my-assembly-project
├── src
│   └── main.asm        # Main assembly source file
├── Makefile            # Build script for compiling and managing files
└── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## Building the Project

To compile the assembly code, use the following command in the terminal:

```
make
```

This will generate the executable from the assembly source file located in the `src` directory.

## Cleaning Up

To remove intermediary files and the executable, run:

```
make clean
```

## Running the Executable

After building the project, you can run the executable with:

```
./main
```

## Requirements

Ensure you have the necessary tools installed to compile assembly code. This project is set up to work with [specific assembler/linker tools, e.g., NASM, GCC].
